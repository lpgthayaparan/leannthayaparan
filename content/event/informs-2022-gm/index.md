title: "INFORMS, 2022: UMOTEM: Upper Bounding Method for Optimizing over Tree Ensemble Models"
abstract: >-
 Machine learning tools have become core to forecasting but the most sophisticated models are not easily optimized over. When tree-based models, such as Random Forest or XGBoost, are used in optimization formulations they then require an exponential number of binary decision variables. These formulations do not scale well and result in intractable formulations. In this work, we propose a scalable approximation of the optimization formulation that can optimize over ensemble tree models in linear time while also showing theoretical bounds on the optimality gap and strong computational results. (Method for Optimizing over Tree Ensemble Models) is an algorithm for optimizing an objective function that is determined by an ensemble tree model.
