abstract: One of the greatest challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the
  way evolving regulation, information, and sentiment have driven waves of the
  disease. Traditional epidemiology models, such as the SIR model, are not
  equipped to handle these behavioral-based changes. We propose a novel
  multiwave susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model, which can detect and
  model the waves of the disease. We bring together the SIR model's
  compartmental structure with a change-point detection martingale process to
  identify new waves. We create a dynamic process where new waves can be flagged
  and learned in real time. We use this approach to extend the traditional
  susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered–dead (SEIRD) model into a multiwave
  SEIRD model and test it on forecasting COVID-19 cases from the John Hopkins
  University data set for states in the United States. We find that compared to
  the traditional SEIRD model, the multiwave SEIRD model improves mean absolute
  percentage error (MAPE) by 15%–25% for the United States. We benchmark the
  multiwave SEIRD model against top performing Center for Disease Control (CDC)
  models for COVID-19 and find that the multiwave SERID model is able to
  outperform the majority of CDC models in long-term predictions.
